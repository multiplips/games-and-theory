Check Primality Functions
Exercise 11

Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your answer to Exercise 4 to help you. Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.
