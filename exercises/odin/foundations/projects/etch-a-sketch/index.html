Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by
introducing a series of modifications.

Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the
squares’ RGB values with each interaction.
Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction
darkens the square by 10%. The objective is to achieve a completely black
square only ten interactions.
Hint: The opacity CSS property is useful here. To learn how to use it, check
this MDN docs article about the opacity CSS property.

You can choose to do either one or both of these challenges, it’s up to you. -->
