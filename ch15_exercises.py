# 15-4. Modified Random Walks: In the RandomWalk class, x_step and 
# y_step are generated from the same set of conditions. The direction 
# is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the 
# list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the values in these lists to see what 
# happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try a longer list of 
# choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the âˆ’1 from 
# the x- or y-direction list.

# 15-5. Refactoring: The fill_walk() method is lengthy. Create a new 
# method called get_step() to determine the direction and distance for 
# each step, and then calculate the step. You should end up with two 
# calls to get_step() in fill_walk():
# x_step = self.get_step()
# y_step = self.get_step()
# This refactoring should reduce the size of fill_walk() and make the 
# method easier to read and understand.
